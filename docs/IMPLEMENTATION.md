# Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of the Transmitter project against the requirements.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Command Line Interface

- [x] **Send Mode**: `transmitter.py send <filename> <ip> <port>`
  - Implemented in `transmitter.py` using `FileSender` class
  - Handles file reading and chunking
  - Connects to receiver and sends file data

- [x] **Receive Mode**: `transmitter.py recv <ip> <port>`
  - Implemented in `transmitter.py` using `FileReceiver` class
  - Listens for incoming connections
  - Saves received files to current directory

### 2. Technical Constraints

- [x] Uses Python standard library only
- [x] Version controlled with Git/GitHub
- [x] Handles command line arguments as specified

### 3. Core Functionality

#### File Sender
- [x] Read file in chunks (default 4KB)
- [x] Connect to receiver
- [x] Send file metadata (filename, size)
- [x] Transmit file data in chunks
- [x] Basic error handling

#### File Receiver
- [x] Listen for incoming connections
- [x] Receive file metadata
- [x] Create or overwrite target file
- [x] Receive data in chunks and write to file
- [x] Basic error handling

## Bonus Features

1. **Multi-threaded Implementation**
   - [x] GUI implementation uses separate thread for file transfer
   - [ ] Handle multiple concurrent connections (receiver side)
   - [ ] Progress reporting during transfer

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - [x] Basic network error handling
   - [ ] Network timeout handling
   - [x] File operation error handling
   - [x] Graceful shutdown on keyboard interrupt

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation
- Uses TCP sockets for reliable data transfer
- Implements basic progress reporting
- Includes proper cleanup of resources
- Has basic input validation
- Includes a GUI implementation (beyond requirements)

### Code Organization
- `transmitter.py`: Main CLI entry point
- `file_transfer_protocol.py`: Core transfer logic (FileSender and FileReceiver classes)
- `file_transfer_gui.py`: Optional GUI implementation

## Testing Status

- [x] Basic file transfer functionality
- [x] Different file sizes
- [x] Basic error conditions
- [ ] Network interruption handling
- [ ] Large file transfers (>1GB)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Core Requirements**
   - None - all core requirements are implemented

2. **Enhancements**
   - Add support for multiple concurrent connections in receiver
   - Implement network timeouts
   - Add more comprehensive error recovery
   - Add transfer speed calculation and ETA

3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Test on different platforms
   - Test with network interruptions

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance**
   - Add compression
   - Implement transfer resumption
   - Add support for UDP for faster transfers (with error correction)

2. **Features**
   - Add checksum verification
   - Support for transferring directories
   - Add encryption for secure transfers
   - Add transfer history and statistics

3. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation
   - Create user guide
   - Add examples

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies (only standard library)

## Building and Running

1. **CLI Mode**
   ```
   # Sender
   python transmitter.py send <filename> <ip> <port>
   
   # Receiver
   python transmitter.py recv <ip> <port>
   ```

2. **GUI Mode**
   ```
   python file_transfer_gui.py
   ```
